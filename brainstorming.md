# Android CodePath Project Ideas

1. NASA API
a. Location based data - combine the NASA Earth API and Google Earth Engine to give users detailed location-based images
b. Mars Exploration - combine daily rover images and Mars Weather observatory to build different options
2. Use flight data API to create flight data app
3. Use Apple Music API to make an alternative music player
4. Use N2YO API to help users find visible satellite/ISS passes at their geographic location
5. Social lending library â€“ users sign up to groups, list their books, borrow, etc
6. Starbucks product description app
7. Volunteer app - match people with local opportunities
8. WordsAPI - help people when working on crossword puzzles, scrabble?, 
9. Anime app ?


# Our Top Three Choices 
1. Social Lending Library
2. Flight Data
3. NASA API - TBD

# Evaluations
## Social Lending Library
### Mobile
Mobile apps are convenient for any book management task, since it lets the uesr bring the app to their bookshelf or reading spot and potentially take pictures of their books using the camera. For a social app, the location info is particularly useful since it supports the idea of other users being nearby.

### Story
This app provides a nice intersection between traditional and digital media. It lets people share their favorite stories with their friends and neighbors, supports community building, and has applications to education. 

### Market
Marketed towards readers who want to share with other readers in their community. Tangible value in the sense that users can explore new books and meet new friends.

### Habit
The average user might open the app every week to check their due dates, see what new books their friends might have, or update their own collection. Users would create content by adding and sharing books, and consume it by browning other users' activity. 

### Scope
We reviewed several potential scopes for this app. On the basic build, a user would sign in, have the ability to create and edit their own library, add friends, and browse friend libraries. On the complex side, book borrowing could be fully implemented, users could mark books as read/have reading lists, and more social features could be added. 
We are working on wireframes but overall the product is fairly well-defined; we have a reasonable shared idea of how it might work.


## Flight Data
### Mobile
People who are interested in flight or airport data are frequently on the go -- maybe they are driving to meet an arriving flight, in the airport getting ready to check in, or otherwise in need of a mobile experience. Having location information, real-time information, and push notifications would support these users.

### Story
The story is mainly the usefulness to travellers, and the ability to help fliers know exactly what to expect when they get to the airport.

### Market
The market is fairly large as it includes all air travelers. It would have value to frequent fliers and their social circle. For example, someone picking up their friend might wish to know if the flight was on time, what terminal it is arriving at, etc.

### Habit
This app would not be habit-forming as it's meant for a specific time-boxed utility. The average user would ideally open it any time they were preparing for a flight, so frequency would depend on their travel. The average user would be consuming information. 

### Scope
We discussed several scope possibilities for this app. On the simplest side, a user could track flights, get plane information, and manage upcoming travel. On the complex side, they could view all local flights and get airport information. Depending on the scope, this could be fairly challenging to build.

## NASA API - TBD
### Mobile
Potentially not a lot of differntiation here, since most visual exploration could be done equally well in a website. 

### Story
There's some opportunities for compelling visual storytelling. NASA makes huge amounts of amazing imagery available, which open up avenues for exploration and education.

### Market
The market is quite large (anyone interested in space), but not very well defined, since we had several possible implementations based on the NASA resources. The value would be mostly entertainment and education.

### Habit
Most NASA APIs update frequently, or daily, so we could give users fresh content on a regular basis. The average user might open it every few days. Interaction would be consuming the new images and information. 

### Scope
We did not scope this project well, since the options offered by NASA are a little overwhelming! The technical challenge for possible apps was pretty manageable. A stripped down version could still be interesting and produce a visually compelling result. 

# Final Vote
We chose the Social Lending Library project.
